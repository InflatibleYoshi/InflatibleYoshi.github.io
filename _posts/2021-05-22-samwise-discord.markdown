One of my side projects was setting up a discord bot that would help people struggling with addiction that I've got approved on Top.gg [here](https://top.gg/bot/693118092565413888). The source code is [here](https://github.com/InflatibleYoshi/discord-samwise).

I used Node.js (relying heavily on Eris.js Libraries) to code the bot, Redis as the backend db, and Kubernetes to wrap everything together.
