One of my side projects was setting up a discord bot that would help people struggling with addiction that I've got approved on Top.gg [here](https://top.gg/bot/693118092565413888). The source code is [here](https://github.com/InflatibleYoshi/InflatibleYoshi.github.io).

I used Node.js to code the bot, Eris.js to interface with discord, Redis as the backend db, Hashicorp Vault to store the credentials, and Kubernetes to wrap everything together.
