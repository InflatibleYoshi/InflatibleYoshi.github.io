My name is Daniel Ananth, I graduated from McGill University in 2018 and am looking for Software Engineering/Devops positions while diving headfirst into Blockchain. 

I've done a lot of Hyperledger Fabric this in 2018 but am doing some work dealing with Ethereum.

I've been working at NetNumber for the past two years where I've been programming in Java and exploring automated testing solutions using Ansible and Jenkins. I've also created a discord bot that I currently run on my Raspberry Pi cluster at home.
